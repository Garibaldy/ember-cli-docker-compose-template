# ember-cli docker-compose template

The docker-compose-template is a simple project stub that is useful for starting new ember project using docker and ember-cli.  It is made up of the following files:

    ```
    ember-project
      docker-compose.yml
      README-template.md
      bash
      ember
      serve
    ```

The `docker-compose.yml` is configured to use the [danlynn/ember-cli](https://cloud.docker.com/u/danlynn/repository/docker/danlynn/ember-cli) docker image from dockerhub.

The `bash`, `ember`, and `serve` commands are [shortcuts](#shortcuts) for performing the most common ember dev tasks.


## Quick start instructions:

  Copy and run the following 3 lines in your terminal to create a new ember app named 'ember-project' and then host it on [http://locahost:4200](http://locahost:4200):
  
  ```bash
    $ proj_dir='ember-project' && curl -Ls https://github.com/danlynn/ember-cli-docker-compose-template/archive/master.zip > "$proj_dir.zip" && unzip -qq -j "$proj_dir.zip" -d "$proj_dir" && rm "$proj_dir.zip" && cd "$proj_dir" && ls -l
    $ ./ember init
    $ ./serve
  ```

## Slightly more detailed instructions:

  Copy this ember-cli-docker-compose-template dir from github with the following command (replacing "ember-project" at the beginning with the name to use for the new project dir):

  ```bash
     $ proj_dir='ember-project' && curl -Ls https://github.com/danlynn/ember-cli-docker-compose-template/archive/master.zip > "$proj_dir.zip" && unzip -qq -j "$proj_dir.zip" -d "$proj_dir" && rm "$proj_dir.zip" && cd "$proj_dir" && ls -l
  ```

  This creates the following directory structure and cd's into the new project directory:

  ```
  ember-project
    docker-compose.yml
    README-ember-cli.md
    bash
    ember
    serve
  ```

  Verify that the "danlynn/ember-cli:latest" found in docker-compose.yml is using the ember version that you want to use.  Otherwise, change it to something like "danlynn/ember-cli:3.8.1".

  Initialize the ember project using the following command. Note that docker will automagically pull the image if required.

  ```bash
  $ ./ember init -b @ember/octane-app-blueprint
  ```

  Test the newly created app by starting the ember server:

  ```bash
  $ ./serve
  ```

  Then open the app in your browser:

    [http://locahost:4200](http://locahost:4200)


## Shortcuts

Three super useful shell commands are included in the project directory: `./bash`, `./ember`, `./serve`.  These shortcut commands invoke their corresponding command within the ember docker container specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file.  Note that you MUST type the `./` in front of each command in order to invoke the shortcuts in the project directory instead of a corresponding command installed on your system.

+ `./bash` - open a bash shell in the ember docker container where you can pretty much poke around and do anything you would normally do on the command line.  Just type `exit` or hit [ctrl-d] to exit the docker container shell and return to your local command line.

  ```bash
  ember-project$ ./bash

  root@5d2d71453fa3:/myapp# npm list webpack
  myapp@0.0.0 /myapp
  `-- ember-auto-import@1.2.21
    `-- webpack@4.28.4 
  root@5d2d71453fa3:/myapp# exit

  ember-project$ 
  ```

+ `./ember` - run any regular ember command in the ember container.

  ```bash
  ember-project$ ./ember generate route products
  
  installing route
    create app/routes/products.js
    create app/templates/products.hbs
  updating router
    add route products
  installing route-test
    create tests/unit/routes/products-test.js
  
  ember-project$
  ```
  
+ `./serve` - run the ember server and tail the log.  Hit [ctrl-c] to stop the ember server.

  ```bash
  ember-project$ ./serve
  $ ./serve

## Annihilation

In case you want to blow away ALL docker-related assets associated with this project (containers, images, volumes, etc) and start over, you can ***with great care*** execute the following:

```bash
$ docker-compose down -v --rmi all
```

If you receive an error at the end of the output of this command that looks like the following, simply ignore it.  It just means that docker skipped deleting the image because it is currently being used by another project on your machine.  All the other docker assets related to this docker-compose project were still successfully removed:

```
Removing test_ember_run_63bdca944a7c ... done
Removing test_ember_1                ... done
Removing network test_default
Removing volume test_node_modules
Removing image danlynn/ember-cli:3.8.1
ERROR: Failed to remove image for service ember: 409 Client Error: Conflict ("b'conflict: unable to remove repository reference "danlynn/ember-cli:3.8.1" (must force) - container 878a05646304 is using its referenced image f1daac6795bc'")
```

Note that this WILL NOT touch any of your source!  But, it will clear out the node_modules.  Before running `./ember` or `./serve` commands, you will need to first re-install all the node_module dependencies with:

```
$ ./bash
# npm install
```
